# Sigga - sigmaker for Ghidra
*The name "Sigga" is a mix of the german word "Digga" (roughly translates to "brother"), and "Signature"*

Sigga is a robust Ghidra script to create and find function signatures. It is well documented and easily maintainable.

## Features
This script contains the core functionality of signature creation, plus advanced features to handle complex, real-world binaries where other tools might fail.

- Create and find function signatures
- Signatures will automatically be copied to the clipboard once created
- **Fast & Efficient 'Sliding Window' Search:** A modern algorithm finds the smallest possible signature and is exponentially faster on large binaries than the original version.
- **[NEW] Signature by Cross-Reference (XRef) Fallback:** If a function's code is too generic to be unique (like a compiler-generated `memcpy`), Sigga will automatically create a signature for the code that *calls* it. This allows it to succeed where many other sigmakers fail.
- **[NEW] Intelligent Stability Analysis:** The logic for what to wildcard is now much smarter, including static data references (`[RIP + disp]`) to create far more robust signatures that are more likely to survive game updates.
- **[NEW] Professional Offset Signatures:** The script now produces industry-standard signatures with offsets, avoiding problematic leading wildcards.

## Installation
To install Sigga, simply [download the latest release](https://github.com/lexika979/Sigga/releases) and put *Sigga.java* inside C:/Users/(your username)/ghidra_scripts. If the folder does not exist yet, create it first. - That's it!

I highly recommend binding Sigga to a shortcut to save yourself a lot of clicks. You can do so like this:

1) Open Ghidra and the Script manager:

2) Open the "Functions" folder:

3) Right click "Sigga" and assign a keybind (I recommend *Ctrl-Alt-S*):

Troubleshooting: In case Sigga does not show up in the list, try to create a new script through the UI and immediately delete it again. That should force Ghidra to acknowledge the ghidra_scrits directory.

Done!

## Sigga in action

Select any function and press your assigned keybind, and Sigga's UI should pop up:
